			<h1>Who we are</h1>
			<h3 class="arial-text">
				This can easily be understood; knowledge proves we are humans and love proves we have knowledge.
				<u>Homo sappiens</u> the scientific name for mankind, not only that we are upright beings but we can also thinks and that's exactly what make us unique.<br>Then, as we can think(we have knowledge), we can also learn from expreince in life; this improves our wisdom. Wisdom includes many aspects like interpersonal intelligence,
				charism and the detection of facial expression. Through wisdom,	we start thinking about life and the world
				around in way we seek our own benefits in everything.<br><br>
				Seeds of love, the way we started, we were a team of individuals we really wanted to help others not because
				we expected any rewards. Only that we really like it and want everyone on the planet to adopt this gold-like
				culture.<br><br>
				In life, we sometimes need the help and support from other, reason why we really have to do the sam things we
				hope other would reflect. Have ever been in a situation where you feel like "even this didn't work", "I have no any other choice" or "What else can I expect"? Now, many people are feeling like how you felt by that time.
				Who deserve it? => No one! If not you giving a hand, who else? So, everyone should stand up and the best they can be. Just for the world around us to reflect the same culture.
